# Electric Vehicals VS. ICE Vehicals
Project title:
Cost benefit analysis between EV and ICE vehicles.

Team Members:
Julian Pecino Joshna Lawrence	Jeremy Del Moral	Elijah Montgomery

Project Description/Outline:
This project aims to explore the affordability comparisons between an Electric Vehicle (EV) and an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) based on the Median income of the U.S.
Research Questions to Answer:
Is an EV affordable for a median income earning family household in the US?

Is an EV appropriate for commercial applications including cross country transport?

What is the Cost comparison over a 5-year span for Tesla Model 3 and Toyota Corolla?

Datasets to be Used:
Data from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alternative-fueling-station-locations-422f2/resource/341957d8-daf6-4a38-ab1d-8ec1bc21cfb from Kaggle
Data from https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017022000796/tsla-20211231.html
Rough Breakdown of Tasks:

Julian: Presentation Slide, Script, Cleaning
Joshna: Plotting, Data Collection
Jeremy: GitHub/Organization
Elijah: Plotting, Data Collection

Everyone: Presentation

Target audience:
Any companies or households that are looking to possibly switch over or consider the alternative of using an EV for financial gain or profit loss mitigation.

Local residents that are on a budget that are trying to find if they can afford switching to an Electric vehicle and if it would be financially sound in the long run vs an internal combustion engine.

Research question:
Analyze the average median income and calculate if the cost of a monthly payment of an EV would still be affordable with the median income set at 51,000.

Results:
Median Income: $51,000                                              
Monthly Income: $4,250                                           
Car Price Budget=Monthly Income* 10%=$425                                         
Total Budget = Monthly Income * 20% = $850           
Model 3 Monthly Payment > Car Price Budget.   
Because $591 > 425.                                               
Model 3 Total Car expense is below the Total Budget because $797 < 850.
Yes it's affordable to have an EV while remaining under budget and there are more choices than anticipated.

Would an EV be appropriate for commercial applications including cross country transport?

Results:
Scatter plot analysis shows that according to the dataset that we used for this check, within the 50 states, the saturation of EV charging stations tend to stay near the major cities off of the coast with a topographic location that isn't completely affected by a mountain range or flat land fields.

Density Variations are more prevalent and correlate with population density.

We found that it would be based off of what the destination is for the commercial vehicle. If there were a set route with charging stations then yes it could be worth it, but if it's going to be to different destinations then it would be better to have an internal combustion vehicle to not risk losing charge in state with a scarcity in charging stations.

What is the Cost comparison over a 5-year span for Tesla Model 3 and Toyota Corolla? (Dataset 5 years)
-Model 3 Total Cost of Ownership: 47841, per month: 797.35                                         
-Toyota Corolla Total Cost of Ownership: 32770, per month: 546.17
-The Toyota Corolla is cheaper by $251.18

Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the Median income household can affford an EV without breaking the bank. That an EV would be useful as a transport medium if there is an established charging route but an ICE vehicle would be best if there is no route established for charging. That over a 5 year span, the Toyota Corolla is $251.18 a month cheaper than the Tesla Model 3.

There is a correlation of EVs and charging stations with population density and location. 

Limitations:
The analysis was only based on a 5 year span, with limited data, findings may not be as accurate as they could be.
The "green premium" that is availed to the EV's was difficult to assign a finite number too so findings could be more accurate if we had that.
